# Calculator

This is a Calculator app. 
Instead of having findViewbById for every digit we press ,I have used the textView so that I can accept the string,  
process it and output the result.

The logic here is to check whether the string contains operator and output the result accordingly.
We shoulnt allow for a single operand to have more than one decimal.

Just download and import into the android studio to use it.
Have Fun!
